<h2>Purpose: </h2>

This exploratory data project set out to analyze the current trends surrounding student loans and determine whether or not they are a subprime bubble or not.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Although student default rates seem to be decreasing in recent years, there are an overwhelming number of factors that support the claim that student loans may be a subprime bubble. Lets restate these trends:
<ol>
 	<li>Outstanding student loan debt has linearly increased over the past 10 years and is in excess of 1.3 Trillion dollars.</li>
 	<li>The average debt of students is linearly increased over the past 10 years and exceeds $27,000 per student.</li>
 	<li>Over 60% of students have student loan debt and 90% of that debt is in federal loans.</li>
 	<li>Since 2009, student loans as a percentage of the US government's assets has increased from 3% to almost 30%</li>
 	<li>7% of young graduates are unemployed, 15% of remaining graduates are underemployed, and 46% are employed in jobs that do not require a college degree.</li>
 	<li>The average cost of college has increased over 30% between 2003 and 2013.</li>
 	<li>Student loan default rates are still high at ~12.5% on average.</li>
</ol>
Furthermore, the U.S. Govt treats these federal loans as if they are triple AAA rated, increasing their portion of total US assets to nearly 30% in 2015, yet they require no credit check on borrowers. Yes, the statistics show that college graduates earn more compared to those who do not graduate college, but the only way to access this college premium is by completing a college degree, but of the 66 percent of young adults who began college, 37.5 havenâ€™t completed their degree by age 27 (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/nlsyth.t01.htm">BLS 2014</a>) Additionally, graduate have not increased alongside increasing tuition costs and consequently the average amount of federal debt each student takes on and this trend only seems to be continuing. Finally, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010's income based payment plans have made it easy for students to pay back the bare minimum of this loans and these loans are entitled to be forgiven after 20 years.

So are student loans a subprime bubble? Besides a sudden, minimal decrease in default rates, the rest of these trends do not bode very well for the ever increasing asset line of the U.S. Govt, but I'll let you be the judge...
